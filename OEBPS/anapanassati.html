        <p>
            <b>So I have heard.</b> At one time the Buddha was staying near
            Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s
            mother, together with several well-known senior disciples, such as
            the venerables Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Mahākaccāna,
            Mahākoṭṭhita, Mahākappina, Mahācunda, Anuruddha, Revata, Ānanda, and
            others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now at that time the senior mendicants were advising and instructing
            the junior mendicants. Some senior mendicants instructed ten
            mendicants, while some instructed twenty, thirty, or forty. Being
            instructed by the senior mendicants, the junior mendicants realized
            a higher distinction than they had before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth
            day—and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks for
            the invitation to admonish. Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha
            of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed them:
        </p>
        <p>
            “I am satisfied, mendicants, with this practice. My heart is
            satisfied with this practice. So you should rouse up even more
            energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and
            realizing the unrealized. I will wait here in Sāvatthī for the
            Komudi full moon of the fourth month.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Mendicants from around the country heard about this, and came down
            to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.
        </p>
        <p>
            And those senior mendicants instructed the junior mendicants even
            more. Some senior mendicants instructed ten mendicants, while some
            instructed twenty, thirty, or forty. Being instructed by the senior
            mendicants, the junior mendicants realized a higher distinction than
            they had before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the Komudi full moon on the
            fifteenth day of the fourth month—and the Buddha was sitting in the
            open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. Then the Buddha looked
            around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed
            them:
        </p>
        <p>
            “This assembly has no nonsense, mendicants, it’s free of nonsense.
            It consists purely of the essential core. Such is this Saṅgha of
            monks, such is this assembly! An assembly such as this is worthy of
            offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a
            religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the
            supreme field of merit for the world. Such is this Saṅgha of monks,
            such is this assembly! Even a small gift to an assembly such as this
            is fruitful, while giving more is even more fruitful. Such is this
            Saṅgha of monks, such is this assembly! An assembly such as this is
            rarely seen in the world. Such is this Saṅgha of monks, such is this
            assembly! An assembly such as this is worth traveling many leagues
            to see, even if you have to carry your own provisions in a shoulder
            bag.
        </p>
        <p>
            For in this Saṅgha there are perfected mendicants, who have ended
            the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to
            be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly
            ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through
            enlightenment. There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who, with the ending of the five
            lower fetters
            <a href="notes-1.html" id="text-1">[1]</a> are reborn spontaneously.
            They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that
            world. There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who, with the ending of three
            fetters
            <a href="notes-2.html" id="text-2a">[2a]</a>, and the weakening of
            greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners. They come back to
            this world once only, then make an end of suffering. There are such
            mendicants in this Saṅgha.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who, with the ending of three
            fetters
            <a href="notes-2.html" id="text-2b">[2b]</a> are stream-enterers,
            not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.
            There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who are committed to developing
            the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
            <a href="notes-3.html" id="text-3a">[3a]</a> … the four right
            efforts <a href="notes-4.html" id="text-4">[4]</a> … the four bases
            of psychic power <a href="notes-5.html" id="text-5">[5]</a> … the
            five faculties <a href="notes-6-and-7.html" id="text-6">[6]</a> …
            the five powers <a href="notes-6-and-7.html" id="text-7">[7]</a> …
            the seven awakening factors
            <a href="notes-8.html" id="text-8a">[8a]</a> … the noble eightfold
            path <a href="notes-9.html" id="text-9a">[9a]</a>. There are such
            mendicants in this Saṅgha. In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who
            are committed to developing the meditation on love … compassion …
            rejoicing … equanimity … ugliness … impermanence. There are such
            mendicants in this Saṅgha. In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who
            are committed to developing the meditation on mindfulness of
            breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mendicants, when mindfulness of breathing is developed and
            cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficial. Mindfulness of
            breathing, when developed and cultivated, fulfills the four kinds of
            mindfulness meditation. The four kinds of mindfulness meditation
            <a href="notes-3.html" id="text-3b">[3b]</a>, when developed and
            cultivated, fulfill the seven awakening factors
            <a href="notes-8.html" id="text-8b">[8b]</a>. And the seven
            awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge
            and freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
            And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be
            very fruitful and beneficial?
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a
            tree, or to an empty hut. They sit down cross-legged, with their
            body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. Just mindful,
            they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.
        </p>
        <p>
            When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’
            When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’
            When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’
            When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’
            They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body. They
            practice breathing out experiencing the whole body. They practice
            breathing in stilling the body’s motion. They practice breathing out
            stilling the body’s motion.

            They practice breathing in experiencing rapture. They practice
            breathing out experiencing rapture. They practice breathing in
            experiencing bliss. They practice breathing out experiencing bliss.
            They practice breathing in experiencing these emotions. They

            stilling these emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
            They practice breathing in experiencing the mind. They practice
            breathing out experiencing the mind. They practice breathing in
            gladdening the mind. They practice breathing out gladdening the
            mind. They practice breathing in immersing the mind in samādhi. They
            practice breathing out immersing the mind in samādhi. They practice
            breathing in freeing the mind. They practice breathing out freeing
            the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            They practice breathing in observing impermanence. They practice
            breathing out observing impermanence. They practice breathing in
            observing fading away. They practice breathing out observing fading
            away. They practice breathing in observing cessation. They practice
            breathing out observing cessation. They practice breathing in
            observing letting go. They practice breathing out observing letting
            go.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated in this way,
            is very fruitful and beneficial.
        </p>
        <p>
            And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as
            to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
            <a href="notes-3.html" id="text-3c">[3c]</a>?
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever a mendicant knows that they breathe heavily, or lightly, or
            experiencing the whole body, or stilling the body’s motion—at that
            time they’re meditating by
            <a href="notes-3.html" id="observing-1"
                >observing an aspect of the body</a
            >—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the
            world. For I say that the in-breaths and out-breaths are an aspect
            of the body. That’s why at that time a mendicant is meditating by
            observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of
            desire and aversion for the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while experiencing rapture,
            or experiencing bliss, or experiencing these emotions, or stilling
            these emotions—at that time they meditate
            <a href="notes-3.html" id="observing-2"
                >observing an aspect of feelings</a
            >—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the
            world. For I say that close attention to the in-breaths and
            out-breaths is an aspect of feelings. That’s why at that time a
            mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen,
            aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while experiencing the
            mind, or gladdening the mind, or immersing the mind in samādhi, or
            freeing the mind—at that time they meditate
            <a href="notes-3.html" id="observing-3"
                >observing an aspect of the mind</a
            >—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the
            world. There is no development of mindfulness of breathing for
            someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say. That’s why at
            that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the
            mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the
            world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while observing
            impermanence, or observing fading away, or observing cessation, or
            observing letting go—at that time they meditate
            <a href="notes-3.html" id="observing-4"
                >observing an aspect of principles</a
            >—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the
            world. Having seen with wisdom the giving up of desire and aversion,
            they watch over closely with equanimity. That’s why at that time a
            mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen,
            aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s how mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated,
            fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
            <a href="notes-3.html" id="text-3d">[3d]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
            <a href="notes-3.html" id="text-3e">[3e]</a> developed and
            cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors
            <a href="notes-8.html" id="text-8c">[8c]</a>?
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body,
            at that time their mindfulness is established and lucid. At such a
            time, a mendicant has activated the
            <a href="notes-8.html#factor-1" id="factor-1"
                >awakening factor of mindfulness</a
            >; they develop it and perfect it.
        </p>
        <p>
            As they live mindfully in this way they investigate, explore, and
            inquire into that principle with wisdom. At such a time, a mendicant
            has activated the
            <a href="notes-8.html#factor-2" id="factor-2"
                >awakening factor of investigation of principles</a
            >; they develop it and perfect it.
        </p>
        <p>
            As they investigate principles with wisdom in this way their energy
            is roused up and unflagging. At such a time, a mendicant has
            activated the
            <a href="notes-8.html#factor-3" id="factor-3"
                >awakening factor of energy</a
            >; they develop it and perfect it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When they’re energetic, spiritual rapture arises. At such a time, a
            mendicant has activated the
            <a href="notes-8.html#factor-4" id="factor-4"
                >awakening factor of rapture</a
            >; they develop it and perfect it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the mind is full of rapture, the body and mind become tranquil.
            At such a time, a mendicant has activated the
            <a href="notes-8.html#factor-5" id="factor-5"
                >awakening factor of tranquility</a
            >; they develop it and perfect it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the body is tranquil and they feel bliss, the mind becomes
            immersed in samādhi. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the
            <a href="notes-8.html#factor-6" id="factor-6"
                >awakening factor of immersion</a
            >; they develop it and perfect it.
        </p>
        <p>
            They closely watch over that mind immersed in samādhi. At such a
            time, a mendicant has activated the
            <a href="notes-8.html#factor-7" id="factor-7"
                >awakening factor of equanimity</a
            >; they develop it and perfect it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of
            <b>body</b> … <b>feelings</b> … <b>mind</b> … <b>principles</b>
            <a href="notes-3.html" id="text-3f">[3f]</a>, at that time their
            mindfulness is established and lucid. At such a time, a mendicant
            has activated the awakening factor of <b>mindfulness</b> …
            <b>investigation of principles</b> … <b>energy</b> …
            <b>rapture</b> … <b>tranquility</b> … <b>immersion</b> …
            <b>equanimity</b> <a href="notes-8.html" id="text-8d">[8d]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
            <a href="notes-3.html" id="text-3g">[3g]</a>, when developed and
            cultivated, fulfill the seven awakening factors
            <a href="notes-8.html" id="text-8e">[8e]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            And how are the seven awakening factors
            <a href="notes-8.html" id="text-8f">[8f]</a> developed and
            cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom?
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of
            <b>mindfulness</b>, <b>investigation of principles</b>,
            <b>energy</b>, <b>rapture</b>, <b>tranquility</b>, <b>immersion</b>,
            and <b>equanimity</b> <a href="notes-8.html" id="text-8g">[8g]</a>,
            which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as
            letting go.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s how the seven awakening factors
            <a href="notes-8.html" id="text-8h">[8h]</a>, when developed and
            cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom.”
        </p>
        <p>
            That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy
            with what the Buddha said.
