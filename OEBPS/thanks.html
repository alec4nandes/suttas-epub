        <p>
            Thank you to Thich Nhat Hanh for inspiring this curated and
            annotated collection. He recommends in his book
            <i>The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching</i> to read these three suttas
            every week as a way to stay close to our practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            And thank you to the worldwide Sangha for keeping the Buddha's
            Dharma alive.
        </p>
