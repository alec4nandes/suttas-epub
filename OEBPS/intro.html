        <p>
            Our fast-paced world offers few refuges. Let the Buddha's words be
            your sanctuary.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Ānāpānassati, Bhaddekaratta, and Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Suttas contain
            lists and concepts that every devoted practitioner should know. Read
            them often — a consistent practice settles our minds and opens our
            hearts. In his book <i>The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching</i>, Thich
            Nhat Hanh recommends reading these 3 special suttas every week.
            That's why we put them all in one place, in a digital format that's
            easily adjustable for any reader.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another highly recommended sutta not included in this collection is
            the
            <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn20/en/sujato"
                >Vitakkasaṇṭhāna Sutta</a
            >
            on how to stop thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
            Bhikkhu Sujato translated these texts and we have annotated them
            further to show how they relate. Explore this book page by page, or
            take a non-linear approach by jumping to the
            <a href="notes.html">Notes</a> section. The links there will lead
            you to deeper explanations in the appropriate texts.
        </p>

        <p>
            With that said, please sit back, tune into your breath, unclench
            your jaw, and read deeply into the wisdom of the Dharma.
        </p>
