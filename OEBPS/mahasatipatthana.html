        <p>
            <b>So I have heard.</b> At one time the Buddha was staying in the
            land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. There the
            Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”
        </p>
        <p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
        <p>
            “Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path
            to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get
            past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end
            the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
        </p>
        <p>
            What four? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of
            the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for
            the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen,
            aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They
            meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful,
            rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an
            aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and
            aversion for the world.
        </p>

        <h3 class="content-header" id="mindfulness-of-breathing-1-1">
            1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing
        </h3>
        <p>
            And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body?
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a
            tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, with their body
            straight, and focuses their mindfulness right there. Just mindful,
            they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.
        </p>
        <p>
            When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’
            When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’
        </p>
        <p>
            When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’
            When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’
        </p>
        <p>
            They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body. They
            practice breathing out experiencing the whole body.
        </p>
        <p>
            They practice breathing in stilling the body’s motion. They practice
            breathing out stilling the body’s motion.
            <a
                href="anapanassati.html#breathing-awareness"
                id="breathing-awareness"
                >(MN 118)</a
            >
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s like a deft carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice. When making a
            deep cut they know: ‘I’m making a deep cut,’ and when making a
            shallow cut they know: ‘I’m making a shallow cut.’
        </p>
        <p>
            And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally,
            externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate
            observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and
            as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is
            established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for
            knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping
            at anything in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.
        </p>
        <h3 class="content-header" id="the-postures-1-2">1.2. The Postures</h3>
        <p>
            Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know: ‘I am walking.’
            When standing they know: ‘I am standing.’ When sitting they know: ‘I
            am sitting.’ And when lying down they know: ‘I am lying down.’
            Whatever posture their body is in, they know it.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally,
            externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate
            observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and
            as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is

            knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping
            at anything in the world.

        <h3 class="content-header" id="situational-awareness-1-3">
            1.3. Situational Awareness
        </h3>
        <p>
            Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going
            out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and
            extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl, and robes;
            when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and
            defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking,
            speaking, and keeping silent.
        </p>
        <p>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …</p>
        <p>

            1.4. Focusing on the Repulsive
        </h3>
        <p>
            Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles
            of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and
            full of many kinds of filth. ‘In this body there is head hair, body
            hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow,
            kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines,
            mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat,
            fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with
            various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas,
            sesame, and ordinary rice. And someone with good eyesight were to
            open it and examine the contents: ‘These grains are fine rice, these
            are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame,
            and these are ordinary rice.’
        </p>
        <p>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …</p>

        </h3>
        <p>
            Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its
            placement or posture, according to the elements: ‘In this body there
            is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the
            air element.’
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s as if a deft butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow
            and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into portions.
        </p>

            Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse discarded in a
            charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days,
            bloated, livid, and festering. They’d compare it with their own
            body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and
            cannot go beyond that.’ And so they meditate observing an aspect of
            the body internally …

            Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a
            charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons,
            dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures.
            They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that

            who want to harm, injure, disturb, and threaten you. The coming

            not come to us!’ But you can’t get that by wishing. This is what is

            suffering’? They are the grasping aggregates that consist of form,
            feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. This is what is
            meant by ‘in brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering’.

        <p>And what is the noble truth of the origin of suffering?</p>
        <p>
            It’s the craving that leads to future rebirth, mixed up with
            relishing and greed, looking for enjoyment in various different
            realms. That is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for
            continued existence, and craving to end existence.
        </p>
        <p>
            But where does that craving arise and where does it settle? Whatever
            in the world seems nice and pleasant, it is there that craving
            arises and settles.
        </p>
        <p>
            And what in the world seems nice and pleasant? The eye in the world
            seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and
            settles. The ear … nose … tongue … body … mind in the world seems
            nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.

        <p>And what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering?</p>

            It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with

            not adhering to it.

            cessation of suffering?
        </p>
        <p>
            It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right
            thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
            right mindfulness, and right immersion.
        </p>
        <p>
            And what is

            suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and
            the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. This is
            called right view.

        <p>
            And what is
            <a href="notes-9.html#thought" id="thought">right thought</a>?
            Thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness. This is
            called right thought.

            refraining from lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, and talking
            nonsense. This is called right speech.

            Refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual
            misconduct. This is called right action.

                >right livelihood</a

        <p>
            And what is
            <a href="notes-9.html#effort" id="effort">right effort</a>? It’s
            when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort,
            exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t
            arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the
            mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen
            are given up. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert

            enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that
            skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but
            increase, mature, and are completed by development. This is called
            right effort.

        <p>
            And what is
            <a href="notes-9.html#mindfulness" id="mindfulness"
                >right mindfulness</a

            body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the
            world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware,
            and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate
            observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of

        <p>
            And what is
            <a href="notes-9.html#immersion" id="immersion">right immersion</a>?
            It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
            secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first
            absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while
            placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the
            mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in
            the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of
            immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind,
            without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the
            fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third
            absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware,
            personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare,
            ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ Giving up pleasure
            and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and
            remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure
            equanimity and mindfulness. This is called right immersion.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the
            cessation of suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally,
            externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate
            observing the principles as liable to originate, as liable to
            vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness
            is established that principles exist, to the extent necessary for
            knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping
            at anything in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of
            principles with respect to the four noble truths.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in
            this way for seven years can expect one of two results:
            enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left
            over, non-return.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let alone seven years, anyone who develops these four kinds of
            mindfulness meditation in this way for six years … five years … four
            years … three years … two years … one year … seven months … six
            months … five months … four months … three months … two months … one
            month … a fortnight … Let alone a fortnight, anyone who develops
            these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven
            days can expect one of two results: enlightenment in the present
            life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to
            convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get
            past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end
            the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.’ That’s what
            I said, and this is why I said it.”
        </p>
        <p>
            That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy
            with what the Buddha said.
