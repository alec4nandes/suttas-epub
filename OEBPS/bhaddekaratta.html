            <b>So I have heard.</b> At one time the Buddha was staying near
            Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the
            Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”
        </p>
        <p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
        <p>
            “I shall teach you the passage for recitation and the analysis of
            One Fine Night. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
        </p>
        <p>“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>
                <span>“Don’t run back to the past,</span

            And how do you run back to the past? You muster delight there,
            thinking: ‘I had such <b>form</b> in the past. I had such
            <b>feeling</b> … <b>perception</b> … <b>choice</b> …
            <b>consciousness</b> in the past.’ That’s how you run back to the
            past.

            And how do you falter amid presently arisen phenomena? It’s when an
            uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is
            neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones.
            They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained
            in the teaching of the good persons. They regard form as self, self
            as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling …
            perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having
            consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
            That’s how you falter amid presently arisen phenomena.

            That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy
            with what the Buddha said.
